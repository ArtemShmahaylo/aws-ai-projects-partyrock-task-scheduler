## Project Description

This project is a simple **Daily Task Scheduler** application built using **AWS PartyRock**, a generative AI playground provided by AWS.  
The goal of the project was to explore how AI-driven tools can be used to rapidly prototype a productivity application without traditional backend or frontend development.

The application allows users to organize daily tasks and improve personal productivity through a lightweight, prompt-based interface. Instead of writing code, the app was created by defining requirements, refining prompts, and iteratively improving the generated components.

This project focuses on:

- understanding prompt-based application design  
- evaluating and improving AI-generated UI components  
- thinking in terms of user needs rather than implementation details  
- recognizing the capabilities and limitations of no-code AI platforms  

While this application is not intended for production use, it serves as a practical learning exercise in generative AI tooling within the AWS ecosystem and demonstrates an early-stage approach to rapid application prototyping.
